# Comments OSINT

Due to reddit praw API restrictions, only 1000 of a users comments can be fetched.

## Frequency

This command generates a frequency per hour of comment submission time. Using this, it tries to work out the timezone of a user by taking into account human sleep. However everone has different lifestyles and as such this command is probably only accurate +/-3 hours, maybe more. However it is still useful as an insight. You can make it display a frequency graph with --display. 

## Words

Show most commonly used words by a user.


## Spelling

Each word used by the target is fed into PyEnchant. This is useful for finding idiosyncratic typing errors by an individual. This will also pick up slang that a user uses. Furthermore, as this will pick up on words that are deemed spelt incorrectly, terms used by esoteric groups that are not in the official dictionary will be picked up. *Note: This is still in beta.*

## Email

Searches for email addresses commented by target user.


# To-do

By default the api only allows you to fetch 1000 comments. There are some workarounds which I have not looked into yet.

Spelling (Note: in beta) will auto flag a subreddit mention as an incorrectly spelled word.
